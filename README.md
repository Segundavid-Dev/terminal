# Terminal UI Project

A fun side project! A **terminal-like web UI built with React + TypeScript**.
I came across the idea and decided to recreate it for experimentation.
The project is **open for contributions** changes, improvements, or new features are all welcomed!

## Features

- **Terminal-style command input:** type commands just like in a real terminal.
- **Command history navigation:** use arrow keys to cycle through previous commands.
- **Instant feedback:** commands return responses directly in the terminal.
- **Styled UI:** clean terminal-like look and feel.
- **Customizable commands:** easily add new commands in the codebase.

This project is just for fun and learning, but contributions are highly encouraged! ðŸŽ‰

- Add new terminal commands
